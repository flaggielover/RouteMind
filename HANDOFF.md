# RouteMind Handoff

Last Known Commit: Current `HEAD`; resolve with `git rev-parse HEAD`

Current Branch: main

Current Phase: P0 Foundation

Current Task: RM-004 - Establish versioned API and event contracts

Task Status: ready

Completed: Repository reconnaissance found an empty greenfield root and an existing
external data boundary. RM-000 established the authoritative control plane, task
graph validation, quality gates, recovery scripts, architecture contract, and ADR.
RM-001 added pinned PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis Compose infrastructure, isolated host
ports, health automation, stable RabbitMQ identity, and persistent volumes.
RM-002 added the Java 17/Spring Boot 4.1.1 business runtime, Maven Wrapper,
layered module boundaries, health and system endpoints, Flyway, and PostgreSQL
schema ownership.
RM-003 added the Python 3.12-3.14/FastAPI compute runtime, an isolated pinned uv
bootstrap, a hash-bearing lock file, framework-free dispatch strategy contracts,
strict boundary/type/lint gates, and loopback-only health/system endpoints.

Tests Run: Stage 0 gates passed. RM-001 passed Compose validation, real health,
PostgreSQL SQL, RabbitMQ diagnostics, Redis authenticated ping, loopback binding,
cross-`down/up` persistence for all three services, and the unified infrastructure
gate. RM-002 passed seven unit, architecture, HTTP, and migration tests; a live
PostgreSQL 18.6 run returned health `UP`, system identity `business-api/java/v1`,
and Flyway history `1:true`. RouteMind processes and containers were stopped.
RM-003 passed Ruff, format, strict mypy, 16 tests with 100% statement/branch
coverage, locked synchronization, and a live Uvicorn HTTP probe. The Python
process was stopped cleanly.

Known Failures: Global `JAVA_HOME` points to JDK 8 while the active `PATH` JDK is
17. Repository Java commands deliberately resolve and validate the active JDK.
Maven is not installed globally; use the repository wrapper script.
The first Python dependency sync took several minutes because uv's cache and the
workspace are on filesystems that do not support hardlinks. The script now fixes
copy mode; subsequent frozen syncs are incremental.

Known Blockers: NONE

Important Context: Keep Java business correctness separate from Python compute and
research. Do not store large datasets or runtime databases in Git. The configured
data boundary is `F:\Projects\RouteMind-Data` on this workstation.

Next Recommended Action: Execute RM-004 by defining independently versioned HTTP
and event contracts, compatibility rules, validation fixtures, and correlation /
causation / trace / event identity fields.

Next Candidate Task: RM-004 - Establish versioned API and event contracts

Relevant Files: `TASK_GRAPH.yaml`, `MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `compose.yaml`,
`scripts/full-gate.ps1`, `scripts/business-api.ps1`,
`scripts/compute-api.ps1`, `services/business-api/README.md`,
`services/compute-api/README.md`, `docs/runbooks/local-development.md`

Do Not Do: Do not collapse the dual runtime, treat Redis as durable truth, bypass
Outbox/Inbox reliability, put large data in Git, or mark tasks passed without gates.
