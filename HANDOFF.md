# RouteMind Handoff

Last Known Commit: Current `HEAD`; resolve with `git rev-parse HEAD`

Current Branch: main

Current Phase: P1 Core Domain

Current Task: RM-010 - Implement core identity and party model

Task Status: passed

Completed: Repository reconnaissance found an empty greenfield root and an existing
external data boundary. RM-000 established the authoritative control plane, task
graph validation, quality gates, recovery scripts, architecture contract, and ADR.
RM-001 added pinned PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis Compose infrastructure, isolated host
ports, health automation, stable RabbitMQ identity, and persistent volumes.
RM-002 added the Java 17/Spring Boot 4.1.1 business runtime, Maven Wrapper,
layered module boundaries, health and system endpoints, Flyway, and PostgreSQL
schema ownership.
RM-003 added the Python 3.12-3.14/FastAPI compute runtime, an isolated pinned uv
bootstrap, a hash-bearing lock file, framework-free dispatch strategy contracts,
strict boundary/type/lint gates, and loopback-only health/system endpoints.
RM-004 added independently versioned JSON Schema 2020-12 API/event contracts,
a conservative compatibility policy, positive/negative fixtures, permanent v1
compatibility baselines, and an executable validator in the frozen Python gate.
RM-005 has a least-privilege GitHub Actions workflow with independent control,
Java, and Python/contract jobs. The Python bootstrap is now portable across
Windows and Linux PowerShell.
RM-010 implements sealed customer, merchant, and courier identities, audited
party aggregates, Flyway V2 persistence, and a JPA repository adapter. H2
repository tests and a real PostgreSQL 18.6 migration/constraint probe passed.
RM-011 implements the order lifecycle state machine, immutable transition audit,
JPA persistence, Flyway V3, and optimistic database versioning. Domain and
repository tests plus a real PostgreSQL migration/persistence probe passed.

Tests Run: Stage 0 gates passed. RM-001 passed Compose validation, real health,
PostgreSQL SQL, RabbitMQ diagnostics, Redis authenticated ping, loopback binding,
cross-`down/up` persistence for all three services, and the unified infrastructure
gate. RM-002 passed seven unit, architecture, HTTP, and migration tests; a live
PostgreSQL 18.6 run returned health `UP`, system identity `business-api/java/v1`,
and Flyway history `1:true`. RouteMind processes and containers were stopped.
RM-003 passed Ruff, format, strict mypy, 16 tests with 100% statement/branch
coverage, locked synchronization, and a live Uvicorn HTTP probe. The Python
process was stopped cleanly.
RM-004 validated four schemas and twelve fixtures, including UUID/date-time
formats, dispatch invariants, and stable event/correlation/causation/trace fields.
RM-005 passed all three jobs in GitHub Actions run 32496271644. The first run
caught Windows-specific Java wrapper paths; commit `de5e608` made JDK and wrapper
discovery portable, after which control, Java, and Python/contract jobs passed.
RM-010 passed 18 Java tests, architecture checks, Flyway V2/Hibernate validation
on PostgreSQL 18.6, health `UP`, role-scoped uniqueness, and audit-order checks.
RM-011 passed 22 Java tests, explicit happy/forbidden/repeated/stale command
coverage, Flyway V3/Hibernate validation on PostgreSQL 18.6, and persisted
transition audit rows.

Known Failures: Global `JAVA_HOME` points to JDK 8 while the active `PATH` JDK is
17. Repository Java commands deliberately resolve and validate the active JDK.
Maven is not installed globally; use the repository wrapper script.
The first Python dependency sync took several minutes because uv's cache and the
workspace are on filesystems that do not support hardlinks. The script now fixes
copy mode; subsequent frozen syncs are incremental.

Known Blockers: NONE

Important Context: Keep Java business correctness separate from Python compute and
research. Do not store large datasets or runtime databases in Git. The configured
data boundary is `F:\Projects\RouteMind-Data` on this workstation.

Next Recommended Action: Execute RM-020 transactional Outbox publishing with
atomic aggregate updates, relay confirmation, and bounded retry.

Next Candidate Task: RM-020 - Implement transactional Outbox publishing

Relevant Files: `TASK_GRAPH.yaml`, `MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `compose.yaml`,
`scripts/full-gate.ps1`, `scripts/business-api.ps1`,
`scripts/compute-api.ps1`, `services/business-api/README.md`,
`services/compute-api/README.md`, `contracts/README.md`,
`docs/runbooks/local-development.md`

Do Not Do: Do not collapse the dual runtime, treat Redis as durable truth, bypass
Outbox/Inbox reliability, put large data in Git, or mark tasks passed without gates.
